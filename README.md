# MaristTwitterBot
A nifty twitter bot that tweets the entirety of the Marist College Student Handbook and Code of Conduct


This bot was written in Python 3.5.2 for hackMarist 2016
The packages used to build this bot were as follows:
pip
setuptools
urllib3
json
and of course the twitter API

This is one of my personal first projects in Python 3.5.2, I had previously worked scarcely with Python 2.7, however, this still proved to be a fun challenge and a nice way to hone my skills.

This project is based off of the LACUNY "Build Your Own Twitter Bot Day" project. I edited some key parts of the code, updated the urllib2 to the more recent urllib3, changed the text file used, the frequency of the tweets and from which lines of text the tweets would be taken. Furthermore I had to update the python language itself since this project was from December of 2015. All in all this project was a fun beginner learning experience for me, and a nice way to start my Hackathon Career.

Don't forget to follow the twitter associated with this bot
  You can find that here: https://www.twitter.com/DidTheFoxesWin

This bot evolved from being a bot which would tweet out whether or not the Marist Red Foxes sports teams won their games, hence the @name.
