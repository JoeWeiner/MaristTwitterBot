# MaristTwitterBot
A nifty twitter bot that tweets the entirety of the Marist College Student Handbook and Code of Conduct


This bot was written in Python 3.5.2 for hackMarist 2016
The packages used to build this bot were as follows: 

tweepy
requests
DataManager
pip
setuptools
urllib3
json
and of course the twitter API
as well as others

This is one of my personal first projects in Python 3.5.2, I had previously worked scarcely with Python 2.7, however, this still proved to be a fun challenge and a nice way to hone my skills.

This project is based off a number of bots including the one built for the LACUNY "Build Your Own Twitter Bot Day" project. A series of bots created for a raspberry Pi event in Austin TX, and scripts made by Faisal-K. I edited some key parts of the code from all of these projects, updated the urllib2 to the more recent urllib3, added additional libraries changed the text files used, the frequency of the processes. Furthermore I had to update the python language itself since these projects were from 2015. All in all this project was a fun beginner learning experience for me, and a nice way to start my Hackathon Career.

This bot evolved from being a bot which would tweet out whether or not the Marist Red Foxes sports teams won their games, to a bot to tweet out the entire student handbook, to a more simple bot that finds tweets associated with Marist College, follows the Tweeters, and adds them to a list so as to document who is talking about Marist College; hence the @name.
